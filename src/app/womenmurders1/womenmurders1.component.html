      <h2>Story 2</h2>
      <p>A 16-year-old boy allegedly raped a 58-year-old woman and murdered her by gagging and hitting her brutally in Madhya Pradesh's Rewa district, a crime suspected to the fallout of a mobile phone theft two years ago, police said on Sunday.
        The incident took place on the night of January 30 in Kailashpuri village under Hanumana police station limits.
        
        The boy allegedly stuffed a plastic bag and a cloth into her mouth, dragged her to an under-construction part of the building where she resided, hit on her head and other body parts with a sickle and also caused injuries to her private parts with a stick, an official said.
        
        The woman's family had accused the boy of stealing a mobile phone two years ago and the boy wanted to take revenge for it, he said.
        
        Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Vivek Lal said an information was received on February 1 that the body of a 58-year-old woman was lying at an under-construction building.
        
        The police and forensic team reached the spot and it was found the woman was brutally murdered by an unidentified person, he said.
        
        On the basis of tip-off from informers and the investigation, the police zeroed-in on the boy living in her neighbourhood.
        
        The woman's family members also expressed suspicion on the boy, who used to come their house to watch television two years back, the official said.
        
        Her family had then accused him of stealing a mobile phone which led to enmity between the boy and the family, the police said.
        
        The boy wanted to take revenge because of the embarrassment he faced in the village following the theft charge, the official said.

      <h2>Story 3</h2>
      <p>A 28-year-old woman, resident of Hayatnagar, approached the police through WhatsApp and informed that she is suffering from domestic violence by husband and in-laws.
        According to Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat, 'She' team's Vanasthalipuram division in-charge Karunakar Reddy reached the victim's house.
        She, however, was not willing to lodge the complaint and instead requested for counseling.
        
        The victim, her husband and in-laws were counseled at Sakhi Counselling Centre Vanasthalipuram through professional family counselors. Police said the husband and in-laws admitted their guilt and compromised.
        The Rachakonda police commissioner appealed to all women suffering from domestic violence to dial 100 or Whatsapp control number 9490617111 for immediate help.
        Bhagwat appealed to people to utilise the helpline for immediate advise, rescue and counseling in domestic violence cases.
        He had earlier said that the domestic violence cases are not getting reported due to movement restrictions and lack of public transport.
        Rachakonda is one of the three police commissionerates covering Hyderabad and its surroundings. Police officers said while routine crimes have declined, domestic violence witnessed spike during the lockdown.
        Cyberabad police comissionerate registered more than 500 domestic violence related calls since the lockdown began last month. Police said they tried to solve a majority of the cases through tele-counselling.
        The National Commission of Women (NCW) also said recently that domestic violence cases increased during the lockdown.
